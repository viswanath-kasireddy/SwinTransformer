# SwinTransformer

This project introduces the application of Swin Transformers
(ST) for detecting common eye diseases, such as Age-related
Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).
This work utilizes a Kaggle dataset of Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT) images in conjunction with Swin Trans-
formers to provide an innovative approach aimed at improving
the accuracy and efficiency of eye disease detection.


To evaluate the performance of an ST-based model, a com-
prehensive comparison with well-established deep learning-
based image classification methods, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Autoencoders, and Generative Ad-
versarial Networks (GANs) was conducted. Evaluation met-
rics such as Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, and Recall were
employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method
both individually and in comparison to the aforementioned
established methods.


The results of this project demonstrate the potential of Swin
Transformers to significantly improve the diagnosis of eye
diseases, offering a promising direction for future advance-
ments in the field of medical image analysis. The efficiency
and accuracy of detection of eye conditions is crucial for
timely intervention and patient care, and this work contributes
valuable insights into the application of state-of-the-art deep
learning techniques for medical diagnosis in this area.
